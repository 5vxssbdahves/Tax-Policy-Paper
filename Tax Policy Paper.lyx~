 €2.7 (DKK20) per kg would reduce the aggregate consumption of saturated
 fat with around three percent and thus prolonging the average life expectancy
 of newly born Dane with 0.003 years or a litte more than one day (0.003*365=1.095).
 In aggregated terms, the Prevention Commission estimated that the three
 procent reduction would add 3,800 years over the next ten years to the
 total living age of the Danish population

The most serious criticism was however that the tax was socially skewed
 in the sense that people with lower income was hit proportionally higher
 by the tax than higher income individuals.
 In particular, calculations made by the interest organisation for the agricultu
ral and food industry in Denmark, the Danish Agricultural & Food Council,
 showed that single parents were proportionally harder hit by the tax than
 other population groups.
 The annual food expenditures of a household with a single parent with two
 children would increase by €136.28 (DKK1,016.00) compared with a household
 of two adults and two children that would experience an increase per adult
 of €219.98/2=€109.945 (DKK1,640.00/2=DKK820.00).

Economic Analysis

\begin_layout Standard
As a starting point for the economic analysis, the opening sentence of Diamond
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 seems pertinent: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In the presence of consumption externalities a natural first response to
 improve resource allocation is corrective pricing (...).
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He proceeds to mention that a Pareto optimal allocation can be achieved
 by levying corrective surcharges above the marginal production cost, which
 is what the Danish tax on unhealthy food can be seen as an example of.
 Moreover, the tax in question does not vary according to the externalities
 from consuming unhealthy foods, so the it is a uniform corrective surcharge.
 For some people it is proportionately more unhealthy to consume fatty and
 sugary foods, but it is for practical reasons not possible to take these
 individual characteristic into account when taxing unhealthy food.
 This effect was in fact already anticipated by the Danish Prevention Commission
 who originally fathered the proposal on saturated fats 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the longer run, consuming unhealthy foods have the negative externality
 of imposing additional burdens on the health sector.
 The demand for hospital services does thus vary with the externalities.
 Given this and the fact the the corrective surcharge is uniform, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "diamond1973consumption"

\end_inset

 writes that we cannot achieve Pareto optimality.
 It is, in other words, not possible to levy exactly the amount of tax that
 corresponds to the additional burden imposed on the health sector from
 consuming unhealthy foods for each and every individual.
 An obvious modification is to levy a weighted average of externalities,
 where the weights are the price elasticities of demand for health services.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This modification does, however, not work under certain circumstances.
 Diamond 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
after "p. 527"
key "diamond1973consumption"

\end_inset

 argues that it is possible, if not also plausible, that some consumer's
 demand will rise with the corrective tax and that this aggregate increase
 in demand exceeds the fall in demand as a result of the direct effect of
 the price rise.
 In this case the weights given are both positive and negative and might
 thus not correspond to the externalities.
 In the example of the tax on unhealthy foods, it is highly unlikely that
 the demands for health services will increase if less unhealthy food is
 eaten, although if consumption is shifted to other unhealthy foods that
 are not sugary or fatty, this could be the case.
 Indeed, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 concluded in their study on saturated fats that we do not know 
\emph on
per se
\emph default
 whether saturated fats cause diseases and that reducing the intake of saturated
 fats only is effective if replaced with whole grain products or unsaturated
 fats from fish and plants.

 Taxing one type of unhealthy food such as those containing saturated fats
 to improve public health works only to the extent that people do not simply
 substitute their consumption to complementary goods that are equally unhealthy.
 It has been argued that the problem is excessive calory intake 
\emph on

 that poses the greatest health risk, so merely taxing one type of unhealthy
 food is unlikely to improve public health significantly.

This implies that it is plausible that a tax on saturated fats would in

 increase the demand for health services, if it is not replaced with healthier
 food as suggested by the study or even replaced with other types of unhealthy
 food.

 Hence, it would not suffice to simply levy the a weighted average of externalit
ies in the case of a tax on saturated fat to achieve Pareto optimality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument above relies on the assumption that the demand for health services
 will vary with the negative externalities generated by consuming unhealthy
 foods.
 In fact, Diamond (1973) investigates the case where the externalities generated
 affects the demand for the good itself.
 The question then is whether people with poorer health eat less foods containin
g saturated fat.
