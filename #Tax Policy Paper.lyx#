Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper will look at the introduction of a tax on food containing high
 amounts of saturated fat in Denmark in 2009.
 The issue of a tax on unhealthy foods plays into a broader debate of how
 policy can contribute to promote healthy eating and thus to increased public
 health meaning lower expenditures for public health services and higher
 productivity in the labour market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to define unhealthy foods and, given that the ultimate
 purpose is improvement of public health, several intermediate objectives
 depending on the context.
 In Denmark the main concern was to reduce cancer and cardiovascular diseases
 in order to increase longevity, while the concern in the UK and US mainly
 relates to obesity.
 These two health concerns are undoubtedly intertwined, but for clarification
 purposes it is useful to keep the two different concerns in mind.
 The policy response also differs.
 Some talk about a tax on sugary soft drinks, while others, as in this paper,
 talk about a tax on saturated fat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, to avoid confusion on the matter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "p. 1244"
key "caraher2005taxingfood"

\end_inset

 suggest that the terms 'food tax' and 'fat tax' be properly distinguished.
 A 'food tax' is thus understood as any surcharge on food, while a 'fat
 tax' is more limited in scope to specific foods containing high amounts
 of saturated fats.
 A tax on sugary soft drinks, which in this paper is used for comparison
 purposes falls under the broader category of a food tax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another terminological clarification concerns the use of 'negative externality',
 which is used interchangably with 'diseconomies'.
 In the case of a tax on unhealthy foods the individual consumer in optimising
 own consumption fails to take into account, i.e.
 internalise, the full social cost of his or her consumption, which is increased
 health costs and fall in labour productivity.
 This failure to internalise the externalities implies suboptimal resource
 allocation, which can be improved by government intervention.
 Thus, from an economic point of view addressing public health risks such
 as obesity makes sense, because obesity has implications for health costs
 and labour market productivity

\begin_layout Standard
The market failure might arise because consumers systematically underestimate
 the negative effects the consumption of foods containing high amounts of
 saturated fats can have in the long-run.
 In this sense it is a problem of imperfect information as consumers do
 not have full information about the detrimental effects of consuming unhealthy
 foods

 was originally adopted by the Danish liberal-conservative government in
 March 2009 as part of a package of reforms meant to lower the Danish labour
 income tax rate, in particular, the effective marginal tax rate and raising
 the work tax credit such that it becomes more profitable to work rather

) in 2009 according to whose calculations a tax on saturated fats of around
 €2.7 (DKK20) per kg would reduce the aggregate consumption of saturated
 fat with around three percent and thus prolonging the average life expectancy
 of newly born Dane with 0.003 years or a little more than one day (0.003*365=1.095
).
 In aggregated terms, the Prevention Commission estimated that the three
 procent reduction would add 3,800 years over the next ten years to the
 total living age of the Danish population

But producers were not the only group criticising the new tax.
 It was also argued the tax was socially skewed in the sense that people
 with lower income was hit proportionally higher by the tax than higher
 income individuals.
 In particular, calculations made by the interest organisation for the agricultu
ral and food industry in Denmark, the Danish Agricultural & Food Council,
 showed that single parents were proportionally harder hit by the tax than
 other population groups.
 The annual food expenditures of a household with a single parent with two
 children would increase by €136.28 (DKK1,016.00) compared with a household
 of two adults and two children that would experience an increase per adult
 of €219.98/2=€109.945 (DKK1,640.00/2=DKK820.00).

\begin_layout Standard
As a starting point for the economic analysis, the opening sentence of Diamond

\end_inset

 seems pertinent: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In the presence of consumption externalities a natural first response to
 improve resource allocation is corrective pricing (...).
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He proceeds to mention that a Pareto optimal allocation can be achieved
 by levying corrective surcharges above the marginal production cost, which
 is what the Danish tax on unhealthy food can be seen as an example of.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the tax in question does not vary according to the externalities
 from consuming unhealthy foods, so it can be defined as a uniform corrective
 surcharge.
 For some people it is proportionally more unhealthy to consume fatty and
 sugary foods, but it is for practical reasons not possible to take these
 individual characteristic into account when taxing unhealthy food.
 This effect was in fact already anticipated by the Danish Prevention Commission
 who originally fathered the proposal on saturated fats 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the longer run, consuming unhealthy foods have the negative externality
 of imposing additional burdens on the health sector.
 The demand for hospital services does thus vary with the externalities.
 Given this and the fact the the corrective surcharge is uniform, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "diamond1973consumption"

\end_inset

 writes that we cannot achieve Pareto optimality.
 It is, in other words, impossible to levy exactly the amount of tax that
 corresponds to the additional burden imposed on the health sector from
 consuming unhealthy foods for each and every individual.
 An obvious modification is to levy a weighted average of externalities,
 where the weights are the price elasticities of demand for health services.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This modification does, however, not work under certain circumstances.
 Diamond 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
after "p. 527"
key "diamond1973consumption"

\end_inset

 argues that it is possible, if not also plausible, that some consumer's
 demand will rise with the corrective tax and that this aggregate increase
 in demand exceeds the fall in demand as a result of the direct effect of
 the price rise.
 In this case the weights given are both positive and negative and might
 thus not correspond to the externalities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example of the tax on unhealthy foods, it could be argued that the
 demands for health services will increase if less unhealthy food is eaten,
 although if consumption is shifted to other unhealthy foods that are not
 sugary or fatty, this could be the case.
 Indeed, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 concluded in their study on saturated fats that we do not know 
\emph on
per se
\emph default
 whether saturated fats cause diseases.
 Furthermore they concluded that reducing the intake of saturated fats only
 is effective if replaced with whole grain products or unsaturated fats
 from fish and plants.

 Taxing one type of unhealthy food such as those containing saturated fats
 to improve public health works only to the extent that people do not simply
 substitute their consumption to goods that are equally unhealthy.
 Elsewhere it has been argued that the problem is excessive calory intake

 that poses the greatest health risk, so merely taxing one type of unhealthy
 food is unlikely to improve public health significantly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument above implies that it is plausible that a tax on saturated
 fats would in fact decrease public health, i.e.
 increase the demand for health services, if it is not replaced with healthier
 food or even replaced with other types of unhealthy food.
 Hence, it would not suffice to simply levy the a weighted average of externalit
ies in the case of a tax on saturated fat to achieve Pareto optimality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument above relies on the assumption that the demand for health services
 will vary with the negative externalities generated by consuming unhealthy
 foods.
 In fact, Diamond (1973) investigates the case where the externalities generated
 affects the demand for the good itself.
 The question then is whether the demand for foods containing saturated
 fat varies with negative externalities generated by consuming such goods.
 The answer is most probably positive, as it is likely that the demand would
 decrease with the diseconomies as people with poorer health eat less fatty
 foods.
 In either case, the demand is probably not affected by the demand by others,
 so the externalities are separable from the demand of all other consumers.
 However, one could imagine a situation in which the individual demand for
 unhealthy foods would increase if the aggregate demand for unhealthy food
 was increased.
 This could be the case if unhealthy foods become more readily available
 or that the people in an individual's social circle increase their consumption
 of unhealthy foods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model put forth by Diamond does not take into account the effect already
 mentioned that a tax on one type of unhealthy food might simply move consumptio
n to another type of unhealthy food with the same type of externalities

One of the controversies surrounding the introduction of the Danish tax
 on saturated fats was that it was argued that it hit lower income groups
 relatively harder than higher income groups.
 In this sense the discussion centers upon one of the three Musgravian taxation
 functions, namely income distribution or distributive equity, because the
 discussion relates to the fairness of

 argues it is difficult to ascertain whether a specific tax is increasing
 or decreasing redistribution, because the notional amounts might be decreasing
 redistribution, while the proportional amount might be increasing redistributio
n.
 One must look at the the revenues of the tax will be spent to understand
 whether the full implications of the tax levy is regressive, progressive
 or neutral.
 In the Danish case, the imposition of the fat tax was introduced as part
 of a tax reform called 'Spring Package 2.0' (

) that had the two main aims of lowering labour income tax and increasing
 taxes on goods that are harmful to the environment and health

 Analysis from the Economic Council of the Labour Movement estimated that
 the distributional effects of this reform package was that most income
 groups get their net incomes reduced, while only groups of the population
 with highest income gain from the reforms.

 Thus, considering that the revenues from the tax on saturated fats is used
 to finance a tax reform that eases the tax burdens of the highest echelons
 of the income hierarchy, the tax on saturated fat can be argued to be regressiv

 They speculate based on the studies by

 income distribution curve, that this is also the case for fatty foods,

 point to the problem of over-consumption by replacing the standard assumption
 of full self-control with an assumption that some consumers may lack perfect
 self-control in the consumption of certain goods.
 In a society without self-control problems a tax on fatty foods would simply
 be distortionary to the otherwise optimal consumption of these products.
 They demonstrate that even in the case of little lack of self-control the
 optimal 'sin' tax is quite large.
 Moreover, they use the concept of a 'sin good'

Another reason according to which a tax should be judged is according to
 the change in total welfare, the tax revenue, the loss of output and who
 bears the main burden of the tax.
 In the case of the tax on saturated fats, the tax is supposed to increase
 total welfare.
 Before the tax we had a market failure, where the competitive equilibrium
 did not maximise total welfare.

 The social marginal cost of consumption was larger than the private marginal
 cost of consumption, so more was consumed than the amount optimising social
 welfare.
 Regarding the tax revenue, the Prevention Commission estimated in 2009
 that the revenue from imposing a DKK20 per kg would generate DKK0.9-1bn
 (€120.7m-134.1m).

Although the imposition of a fat tax might have allocative efficiency and
 welfare enhancing outcomes, the evidence from Denmark suggests that it
 also imposes considerable administrative costs on the suppliers.
 Determining whether these costs outweigh the benefits is crucial in understandi
ng the total effects of fat taxes, but difficult to ascertain in practice.
 The administrative burden arises from the requirement that companies selling
 products containing high amounts of saturated fats have to collect the
 tax through higher prices and then pass on the tax to the tax authorities.
